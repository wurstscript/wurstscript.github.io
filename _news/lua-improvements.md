## Advanced Updates to Lua Mode in WurstScript: Bridging the Gap Between Jass and Lua

We're excited to share that we've been methodically rolling out updates to enhance the Lua mode in WurstScript. Our focus has been on creating a seamless development experience, irrespective of whether you're working in Jass or Lua. Here's a closer look at the strides we've made and what lies ahead.

### Achieving Consistency Between Jass and Lua Outputs

One of our key objectives has been to align the outputs of Jass and Lua to ensure they produce identical results. This involves meticulous adjustments to the standard library to eliminate dependencies on Jass-specific behaviors, thereby fostering a more universal coding environment.

### Full Support for `wurst.build` Data Injection in Lua Mode

We've also fully integrated support for `wurst.build` data injection in Lua mode. This means developers can now leverage the full power of Wurst's build system, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of map development in Warcraft III Reforged.

### Navigating the Intricacies of Lua Execution in Warcraft III Reforged

Despite our efforts to standardize the development process across both languages, the intrinsic differences in Lua's execution within Warcraft III Reforged present unique challenges. While some discrepancies are unavoidable, our team is committed to minimizing these differences and ensuring a smooth operational flow with either mode using the same Wurst code.

### Looking Ahead: Exclusive Lua Features

Looking forward, we're not just focused on parity; we're also excited to explore Lua-specific enhancements that will unlock new possibilities for map developers. These features will take advantage of Lua's unique capabilities, offering tools and functionalities that are not feasible with Jass. Stay tuned for updates on these developments.

### The Future of WurstScript Development

Our vision for WurstScript is to provide a robust, flexible, and user-friendly scripting environment for Warcraft III map developers. By continually refining Lua mode and exploring new features, we aim to empower creators with more tools and greater creative freedom. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable as we push the boundaries of what's possible in map development.
