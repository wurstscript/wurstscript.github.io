## Exciting Enhancements to JHCR Support in WurstScript

We're thrilled to announce recent updates and additions to **JHCR (Jass Hot Code Reload)** by @lep, alongside significant upgrades to its support within WurstScript.

### Integrated Hot Reload Functionality

The hot reload feature now seamlessly integrates with `wurst.build` map data injection, enhancing the development workflow. Leveraging the newly added JHCR API, we are now able to display the status of each reload operation directly, providing immediate feedback to developers.

### Streamlined Development with JHCR

JHCR revolutionizes the way we work with Jass by allowing the reloading of code changes without the need to restart the map. This advancement significantly speeds up the testing and development cycle, making it easier than ever to iterate on your Warcraft III maps.
