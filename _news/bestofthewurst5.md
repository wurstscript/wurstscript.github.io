# 1.29 and PTR

The wurst team is excited and curious to see what the new PTR changes will mean for the wc3 modding community. We are anticipating the release to the stable battle.net realms, and will add support to the wurst toolchain as soon as possible.

At this time, we do not plan to have a separate branch to support PTR installs. However, if the classic team continues to make extensive use of the testing realm, we may consider that option in the future.

We are actively thinking about what the PTR changes will mean for us and how it should affect 2018's timeline. For example, now that 24-player maps are coming, we will prioritize support for editing map player metadata from vscode.

Updates
===

We are quite a bit late with our blog post this month, as there were no major updates to present and we were focusing on quality work as well as keeping an eye on Wurstâ€™s stability. That being said, in march we revamped the lambda syntax for more flexibility and cleaner code. Additionally we again have received a number of contributions from the community.

* Type inference plus new block handling for lambda expressions and closures
* We resolved several opened issues ([#44](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/issues/44), [#45](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/issues/45), [#48](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/issues/48)) and merged 7 pull requests ([#47](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/47), [#49](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/49), [#50](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/50), [#51](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/51), [#51](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/52), [#54](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/54), [#55](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/55), [#56](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstStdlib2/pull/56)) for the standard library.
* The Wurst Setup received several stability updates and we are working on further integration with the wurst tool suite.

*Note*: We are still looking for Wurst Resources for our [showcase](https://wurstlang.org/showcase.html)!

New Lambda Shenanigans
---
Types are now optional when writing lambda expressions:
```wurst
interface UnitFunction
    function run(unit u)

function group.foreach(UnitFunction closure)
    ...

// Before:
g.foreach((unit u) -> print(u.getName()))
// Now also possible:
g.foreach(u -> print(u.getName()))
// Works for multiple params too:
list.foldl((x, y) -> x + y)
```
Additionally, you can now get rid of `begin` and `end` keywords for statement lambdas if the lambda is the last argument in the current line. The lambda is them moved behind the function call like so:
```wurst
// Before:
doAfter(10.0, () -> begin
	u.kill()
	createNiceExplosion()
	doMoreStuff()
end)

// Now also possible:
doAfter(10.0) ->
	u.kill()
	createNiceExplosion()
	doMoreStuff()
```


With the new syntax the indentation defines the block. This allows one to define customized control flow, which looks very similar to a construct built into the language.

The `begin` and `end` syntax will of course remain for backwards compatibility and for when the lambda isn't the last argument.

Wurst Spell Excursion
---

Spells are a very popular choice to script in wc3, and most maps have at least some scripted abilities.

Here we will show a concise example of how to combine object-editing, event listening and the use of closures to create a decent spell without much hassle.

In this case we are making a timed explosion spell called "Conflagration". The explosion applies a burn debuff to hit enemies, which causes successive conflagration hits to deal bonus damage. We aim to make the spell easily configurable and in the end upload  it to github so it can be easily imported into a wurst project.

Configuration package
---

To make a nicely configurable spell, it can sometimes help to think about the configuration package first. Based on the concept, we know in what way we want to allow the user to customize the ability, like:

- base damage, bonus damage
- spell radius, effect, duration
- buff duration, effect

To put this into wurst code, we create a new package with the variables from the list. In order for them to be configurable by the user, we must annotate them with `@configurable`.

```wurst
package ConflagrationConstants
import public Assets

@configurable public let BASE_DAMAGE = 50.
@configurable public let BONUS_DAMAGE = 50.

@configurable public let SPELL_EFFECT_PATH = Units.infernalBirth
@configurable public let BONUS_EFFECT_PATH = Abilities.fireBallMissile
@configurable public let SPELL_EFFECT_DURATION = .75
@configurable public let SPELL_RADIUS = 256.

@configurable public let SPELL_ICON = Icons.bTNBreathOfFire
@configurable public let SPELL_NAME = "Conflagration"
@configurable public let SPELL_TT_NORMAL = "Cast Conflagration"
@configurable public let SPELL_TT_EXTENDED = "Conjures a firey explosion at the " +
    "target, damaging nearby enemies and applying a buff, which will cause them to " +
    "take more damage on succeeding hits of this spell."

@configurable public let BUFF_DURATION = 7.5
@configurable public let BUFF_EFFECT_PATH = Abilities.incinerateBuff

@configurable public let BUFF_NAME = "Conflagrated"
@configurable public let BUFF_TT = "This unit has weakness to fire"
```

Clearly, the above paints a picture of a quick, unit-style spell with fairly low damage and duration.


Spell objects
---

Next we'll generate the required objects for our spell. We will be needing an ability object for the unit that uses the spell, and a buff object that displays the presence of conflagration visually and as status.

Thus we create a new package
```wurst
package ConflagrationObjects
import public ConflagrationConstants
import public BuffObjEditing
import ChannelAbilityPreset

public let SPELL_ID = compiletime(ABIL_ID_GEN.next())
public let BUFF_OBJ = compiletime(createDummyBuffObject(BUFF_NAME, BUFF_TT,	Icons.bTNFireBolt, Abilities.incinerateBuff, "chest"))

@compiletime function genObj()
    new ChannelAbilityPreset(SPELL_ID, 4, true)
    ..setName(SPELL_NAME)
    ..presetTooltipNormal(lvl -> SPELL_TT_NORMAL)
    ..presetTooltipNormalExtended(lvl -> SPELL_TT_EXTENDED)
    ..presetIcon(SPELL_ICON)
    ..presetButtonPosNormal(0, 0)
    ..presetManaCost(lvl -> 0)
    ..presetCooldown(lvl -> 4.)
    ..presetHotkey("Q")
    ..presetTargetTypes(Targettype.POINT)
    ..presetAreaofEffect(lvl -> SPELL_RADIUS)
    ..presetOption(Option.TARGETIMAGE, true)
```

Spell effect
---

Finally we create the actual effect. At the map's initialization we register a spell event listener, which will fire when any unit casts our generated spell.

```wurst
package Conflagration
import ConflagrationObjects
import ClosureTimers
import ClosureForGroups
import HashMap
import ClosureEvents

let buffId = BUFF_OBJ.abilId
let buffMap = new HashMap<unit, CallbackSingle>()
init
	EventListener.onPointCast(SPELL_ID) (caster, tpos) ->
		flashEffect(SPELL_EFFECT_PATH, tpos)
		doAfter(SPELL_EFFECT_DURATION) ->
			forUnitsInRange(tpos, SPELL_RADIUS) u ->
				if u.hasAbility(buffId)
					caster.damageTarget(u, BONUS_DAMAGE)
					flashEffect(BONUS_EFFECT_PATH, tpos)

				caster.damageTarget(u, BASE_DAMAGE)
				u.addAbility(buffId)
				if buffMap.has(u)
					destroy buffMap.get(u)
				let cb = doAfter(BUFF_DURATION) ->
					if buffMap.has(u)
						buffMap.remove(u)
						u.removeAbility(buffId)
				buffMap.put(u, cb)
```

We are using `EventListener.onPointCast` from `ClosureEvents.wurst` to do do the event listening for casts of `SPELL_ID`. On a `SPELL_EFFECT` event with the right id, the following indented codeblock will be executed. The lambda parameters `(caster, tpos)` will be filled appropriately with the caster unit and the target point.

Creating a repository for our project
===

Finally, let's create a git dependency from our wurst project. We will be  using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and it's corresponding [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) which requires a free account. If you don't already have one, please create an account and setup the app.

Once you have the app setup, we can create a new git repo inside our project folder by choosing `File -> Add Local Repository`. Select the root of your project and then select `create a repository`:

![](/assets/images/blog/bestof5/addRepo.png){: .img-responsive}

Leave all settings as is and create the repository:

![](/assets/images/blog/bestof5/createRepo.png){: .img-responsive}

Hooray, our repository is created. All our existing files have been added to an initial commit. Files that shouldn't be versioned are automatically ignored by the configuration generated by the setup tool. We can now publish our repository:

![](/assets/images/blog/bestof5/publishRepo.png){: .img-responsive}

If everything went well, you repository is now published. You can view the repository we created in this blog post here: https://github.com/Frotty/ConflagrationSpell

**Note** If you want to know more about the git workflow, you can checkouts everal tutorials online, like [this one](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

Using the repository as wurst dependency
---

Open the setup tool and import the wurst.build file of some other project. Under `Advanced` you can now enter the link to the repository that we created above. Hit `Update Project` to update the dependencies.

![](/assets/images/blog/bestof5/setup1.png){: .img-responsive}

![](/assets/images/blog/bestof5/setup2.png){: .img-responsive}

Reload VSCode and you should be able to import the spell as necessary.

And that's it! Thanks for reading another Best of the Wurst blog-thing.

Cheers
