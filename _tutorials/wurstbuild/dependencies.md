## File Structure

The `wurst.build` file is a yaml file that must reside in the root of your project. The `wurst` folder should be right next to it.
This file controls your project's dependencies and how the map is configured upon a build task.
Almost all values in this file are optional. Incomplete or invalid config will be completed by using the map's existing configuration and default values.
The schema is provided on project install for auto complete in vscode. You will also find a full example file below.

```yml

## Dependencies

The project's dependencies are listed at the top of the `wurst.build` file and downloaded when the project is installed using `grill install`.
A dependency is a simple url to a public git repo, which can be pulled by the setup.
Projects created by the setup include the standard library dependency by default: `https://github.com/wurstscript/wurstStdlib2`.

To add a dependency run `grill install` with a valid, accesible git repo url, e.g. `grill install https://github.com/frotty/frentity`.
This will checkout the dependency locally and also add an entry to the `wurst.build` file.

The setup does no version locking for now, but this is planned for a future version. Transitive dependencies will not be resolved.
You can target specific branches using a suffix, e.g. `https://github.com/wurstscript/wurstStdlib2:pre1.29`.

## Build Map Data

Following the dependencies is the build map data, which offers most of the settings you would normally find in the `Scenario Settings` in the World Editor.
Such as the description, players, forces and the loading screen. The configuration will then be applied to the input map of any run or build task of the project.
